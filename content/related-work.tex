\paragraph{VM already knew that}

\begin{cnote}
- based on Higgs JavaScript VM
- SafeTypeScript
  - system of object contracts
  - checked lazily where possible
  - optimized by recording the object contracts as part of the shape
  - this technique is essentially identical to ours
    - our type information is encoded in the shape, too
    - however, we check conformance eagerly
      - this is as part of having semantics for Grace that provide immediate
        feedback on correctness
    - from a performance perspective, their approach could have an even higher
      cost: increased degree of polymorphism (ours is not increased,
      because we do not use shape trees.
      each class has a single shape, shared by all instances
      the type is based on the specified members, which are statically known)

- Higgs
  - no inlining, escape analysis, tuned GC, etc.
  - any optimizations across basic blocks (beside type propagation)
