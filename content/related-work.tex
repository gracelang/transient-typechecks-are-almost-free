\begin{cnote}
- based on Higgs JavaScript VM
- SafeTypeScript
  - system of object contracts
  - checked lazily where possible
    i.e., when accessing an object (reading, writing fields, method invocations are preceded by field read)
    for a function object, which may have contracts, before it is invoked
  - as described in sec. XX, we only check the availability of methods/fields
    in a type
    - this has also consequences on checking higher-order functions
      - we only check whether they take the expected number of arguments,
        which is part of their type, but don't check types of their arguments
        (same for normal methods)
  - optimized by recording the object contracts as part of the shape
  - this technique is essentially identical to ours
    - our type information is encoded in the shape, too
    - however, we check conformance eagerly
      - this is as part of having semantics for Grace that provide immediate
        feedback on correctness
    - from a performance perspective, their approach could have an even higher
      cost: increased degree of polymorphism (ours is not increased,
      because we do not use shape trees.
      each class has a single shape, shared by all instances
      the type is based on the specified members, which are statically known)

- Higgs
  - no inlining, escape analysis, tuned GC, etc.
  - any optimizations across basic blocks (beside type propagation)
