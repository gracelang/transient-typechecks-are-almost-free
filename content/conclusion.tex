\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%% Context
With the wide-spread use of dynamically, optionally, and gradually
typed languages, efficient techniques for  type checking
become more important.
%
%% goals
%% approach to support types in a dynamic language
%% - without significant overhead
%% - simple to implement
%
%
%
%
% This work proposes a new design for checking shallow structural
%  types at run time.
%  The main goal of the design was to enable an implementation that
%  does not introduce significant run time overhead.
%  A secondary goal was to be able to implement this approach for
%  existing language implementations with only a small amount of work.
%
In this paper, we have demonstrated that relatively straightforward VM optimizations enable
dynamic checks of shallow structural types with relatively little
overhead, and require only small modifications to an AST interpreter.
We evaluated this approach with Moth, an implementation of the Grace language
on top of Truffle and Graal.

%% proposed technique
%% - shallow structural types
%The proposed approach to shallow types considers only the names of
%type members. 
% Thus, it does not consider types on these members.
% With this shallow design, we enable flexibility in the sense that
% globally inconsistent programs can still be executed and
% checked for consistency with their annotations as far as
% that particular execution goes%
% --- an attribute that supports an incremental style of development
% that may be more common among students learning programming---%.
% Furthermore, it enables precise feedback on type violations
% without requiring blame tracking,
% as it is usually needed for approaches to gradual typing
% at the cost of run-time performance.

%% - type checks, optimization based on object shapes
In our implementation, types are structural and shallow: a type
specifies only the names of methods supported by objects, and not
the types of their arguments and results.
These types are checked on access to variables,
when assigning to method parameters, and also on return values.
The information on types is encoded as part of an object's shape,
which means that shape checks already performed in an optimizing dynamic
language implementation can be used to check types, too. 
Being able to tie checks to the shapes in this way is critical for 
reducing the overhead of dynamic checking.
%
%% results
%% + context (baseline)

Using the \AWFY benchmarks as well as a collection of benchmarks from the
gradual typing literature, we find that our approach to dynamic type checking
introduces an overhead of 
\OverheadTypingGMeanP (min. \OverheadTypingMinP, max. \OverheadTypingMaxP)
on peak performance.
Since Moth reaches the performance of a
highly optimized JavaScript VM such as V8,
we believe that these results are a good indication
for the low overhead of our approach.

%% relevance
%%   where to go from here?

%% future work
In specific cases, the overhead is still significant and requires further
research to be practical. Thus, future research should investigate how the
number of dynamic type checks can be reduced without causing
the type feedback to become too imprecise to be useful.
One approach might increase the necessary changes to a language implementation,
but avoid checking every variable read.
Another approach might further leverage Truffle's self-specialization
to propagate type requirements and avoid unnecessary checks.
%%  - investigate optimizations
%%  - might enable a full structural type system, \ie, not shallow
%%  - verify results of Richards2017 in context of highly optimizing VM

Finally, we hope to apply our approach to full structural types with blame that
support the gradual guarantee.

% For transient semantics   \cite{reticPython2014}
%
This should let us verify that \citet{Richards2017} result generalize
to highly optimizing virtual machines,
or alternatively other optimizations for precise blame would need to be investigated.
