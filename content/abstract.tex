%
  Languages with optional explicit dynamic type checking, like
  Typescript, Dart, Groovy, and Grace are increasingly popular in
  practical development and programming education.  Unfortunately,
  current implementations of these languages perform worse than either
  purely statically or purely dynamically typed languages.  We show
  how virtual machines can use common optimisations to remove
  redundant dynamic type checks, by adding dynamic type
  checks to Moth, a Truffle-based interpreter for  Grace.
% or "for thr Grace programming language."
  Moth runs programs with dynamic type checks
  roughly as fast as programs without checks, so developers do not
  need to disable checks in production code, and
  educators can teach types without also teaching that types slow
  programs down.

%% Removing \kjx{redundant} type tests makes programs in these
%% languages run faster. 
% We add shallow-structural type checking
% to an existing interpreter Grace, 
%that enables developers to check 
%that executions of their program are well-typed. % WTF else would you
%need 'em
%
% Grace is designed primarily for education and, consequently,
% the performance profile of its execution is important
% to enable both teachers and students to explore different concepts.
%
% Following from Grace's design goals,
% our focus is to provide flexible checking
% with minimal overhead to execution.
% We achieve flexibility through our shallow-structural design and,
% for our implementation, 
% we achieve minimal overhead by
% taking advantage of common JIT VM techniques 
% that can remove much of the overhead of dynamic type checking;
% allowing programs with explicit dynamic checks 
% to run at roughly the same speed as programs without those checks.
% Overall, adopting common JIT techniques can make these languages
% more effective in practice.
