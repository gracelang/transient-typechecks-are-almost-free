\begin{abstract}

Languages with optional dynamic types, like
Groovy, Dart, and Typescript,
are becoming increasingly popular in practical development and education. Unfortunately,
current implementations of gradual languages tend to
perform worse than either purely static or purely dynamically typed languages. Removing type tests make programs in these languages run faster. 
We add a new shallow-structural type system, 
to an existing interpreter Grace, 
that enables developers to check 
that executions of their program are well-typed.
Grace is designed primarily for education and, consequently,
the performance profile of its execution is important
to enable both teachers and students to explore different concepts.
Following from Grace's design goals,
our focus is to provide a flexible type system
with minimal overhead to execution.
We achieve flexibility through our shallow-structural design and,
for our implementation, 
we achieve minimal overhead by
taking advantage of common JIT VM techniques 
that can remove much of the overhead of dynamic type checking;
allowing programs with explicit dynamic checks 
to run at roughly the same speed as programs without those checks.
Overall, adopting common JIT techniques can make these languages
more effective in practice.
