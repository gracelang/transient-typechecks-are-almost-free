\begin{cnote}
- pathological case
  var a = obj
  while (...) \{
    a = a.next
  \}
  in this case, we introduce a new type check that does not coincide with any
  existing checks (shape check on method dispatch, etc)
  consequently, we see overhead that can be up to XX\% (cf. sec. XX).


- possible optimization for reads

 \sm{do we say very precisely what is done in the implementation section?}
\end{cnote}
