\subsection{Methodology and Setup}

\begin{cnote}
- benchmark selection
 - baseline determined based on AWFY
 - dynamic type checking performance determined based on commonly used
   benchmarks from the gradual typing papers
   - name the benchmarks
   - for each, indicate which paper used them
   - we are subsetting, need to explain why
     - the subset of benchmarks that we managed to port to Grace/Moth
\end{cnote}

\subsection{Are we fast yet?}
\label{sec:baseline-perf}

\begin{cnote}
- setting a base line with the AWFY benchmarks
- comparing
  - Java
  - Node.js
  - Moth
  - Higgs
- arguing that Moth has state of the art performance on the given benchmarks
- this is a reasonable foundation to make performance claims
  that can generalize to state-of-the-art custom VMs such as V8
\end{cnote}

\subsection{Performance of Dynamic Type Checking}

\begin{cnote}
  - which experiments?
  
  - fully types
  - no types
  - no types on fields
  - all run on moth

\end{cnote}
