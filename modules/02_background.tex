\subsection{Gradual-Typing Today}

Takikawa et al. \cite{Takikawa2016} ask whether sound gradual typing is dead, and Richards et al. \cite{Richards2017} say no, provided one has support from the VM.

\cite{Greenman2017} introduces a tag-soundness system.

\subsection{Self-Optimizing Virtual Machines}

While not everyone has time to create their own fully-fledged virtual, recent efforts such as PyPy \rrnote{CITE Tratt} or Truffle and Graal \cite{Wurthinger2013} are brining the power of VMs to researchers and hobbyists.

As shown by Marr et al. \cite{Marr2016}, the peak performance of benchmarks is comparable to monolithic VM's like V8 and Crystal.
