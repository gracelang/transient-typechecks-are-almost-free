\subsection{Self-Optimizing Virtual Machines}

While not everyone has time to create their own fully-fledged virtual, recent efforts such as PyPy \rrnote{CITE Tratt} or Truffle and Graal \cite{Wurthinger2013} are brining the power of VMs to researchers and hobbyists.

As shown by Marr et al. \cite{Marr2016}, the peak performance of benchmarks is comparable to monolithic VM's like V8 and Crystal.
