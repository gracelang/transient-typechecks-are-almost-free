\note{Problem} Languages with optional dynamic types, like  Groovy, Dart, and Typescript*, are becoming increasing popular in practical development and education.

\note{Why it's a problem} Unfortunately, current implementations of gradual languages tend to perform WORSE than either purely static or purely dynamically typed languages.  Removing type tests make programs in these languages run faster. 

\note{Startling sentence} Common JIT VM techniques can remove much of the overhead of dynamic type checking, allowing programs with explicit dynamic checks to run at roughly the same speed as programs without those checks.

\note{Why it matters}. Adoption common JIT techniques can make these languages more effective in practice.
