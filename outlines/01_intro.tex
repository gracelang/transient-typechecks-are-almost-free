\1 Problem Statement
    \2 Despite increasing popularity gradual typing are still not alive
    \2 Recently, research efforts has been made to improve the run time cost
        \3 reduce overhead by adding VM support

\1 Benefits
    \2 simple to implement
    \2 fast peak performance
        \3 number of type checks reduced in compiled code
        \3 minimal overhead since checks folded with invocation

\1 Our solution
    \2 Follow a similar direction
        \3 adapt SOMns to support dynamic checks for Grace
        \3 but not full gradual-structural system
        \3 Use existing VM support to reduce overhead
        \3 Not full system; but provides foundations
    \2 Evaluation
        \3 benchmarks (SOMns)
        \3 benchmarks (Language Game)

\1 Context: toward gradual-structural typing
