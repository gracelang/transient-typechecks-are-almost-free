\1 Problem Statement
    \2 Despite 
    \2 gradual typing still not alive
    \2 recent work (\cite{Richards2017,Greenman2017} moving in right direction
    \2 we move toward support for Grace's gradual-structural type system
    \2 scope is as far as simple \emph{responds-to} dynamic checks 

\1 Approach
    \2 Moth
        \3 adapt SOMns for use with Grace, via AST translation
        \3 add support for type checking
    \2 add knowledge of types into AST
        \3 arguments are typed
        \3 invokable are typed (return)
    \2 fold type checking into method invocation
        \3 dispatch guards check arguments for expected value
        \3 somehow check return value before popping frame?
        \3 somehow trace assumptions?
    \2 implement structural type checking using sub-typing table

\1 Benefits
    \2 simple to implement
    \2 fast peak performance
        \3 number of type checks reduced in compiled code
        \3 minimal overhead since checks folded with invocation

\1 Drawbacks
    \2 slower start up
    \2 need access to the VM
    
\1 Evaluation
    \2 benchmarks (SOMns)
    \2 benchmarks (Language Game)

\1 Contribution
    \2 implementation of dynamic checks in Moth for Grace on SOMns
    \2 performance showing only little slowdown

\1 Context and scope
    \2 won't address gradually typing
    \2 not full structural system
    \2 soundness up to blame
    \2 evidence that we can use VM to reduce overhead
    \2 using the existing as a research vehicle
        \3 move toward an efficient gradual-structural system for Grace
        \3 properly challenge whether sound gradual typing is dead
