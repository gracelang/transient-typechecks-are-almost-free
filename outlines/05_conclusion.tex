\1 Summary
    \2 Repeat problem: support basic type checking for Grace
    \2 Contribution 1: evidence that we can use VM to reduce overhead
    \2 Contribution 2: implementation of dynamic checks in Moth for Grace on SOMns

\1 Limitations
    \2 need access to VM
    \2 Slow start up speed
    \2 not full structural system

\1 Future work
    \2 using the existing as a research vehicle
    \2 make it sound
    \2 support the full type system
    \3 by doing so, we can properly challenge whether sound gradual typing is dead
