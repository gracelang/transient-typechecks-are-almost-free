 Transient gradual typing imposes run-time type tests that typically cause a 
 linear slowdown in programs' performance.
 %
 This performance impact discourages the use of type annotations
 because adding types to a progam makes the program slower. 
 %
 A virtual machine can employ standard just-in-time optimizations to
 reduce the overhead of transient checks to near zero.
 %
 These optimizations can give gradually-typed languages
 performance comparable to state-of-the-art dynamic languages,
 so programmers can add types to their code
 without affecting their programs' performance.

  %% It is widely accepted that the additional run-time checks in a
  %% gradually-typed language must cause a linear slowdown in the program's
  %% execution.
  %% %
  %% This performance impact discourages the use of type annotations
  %% because adding types can significantly worsen performance, despite the
  %% benefits of typed code.
  %% %
  %% We show that in fact the overhead of transient checks can be near zero
  %% with appropriate application of standard just-in-time optimization
  %% techniques.
  %% %
  %% With these techniques programmers need not avoid adding types to their
  %% code and a gradually-typed language can have run-time performance
  %% comparable to state-of-the-art dynamic language implementations.
%
%% Removing \kjx{redundant} type tests makes programs in these
%% languages run faster. 
% We add shallow-structural type checking
% to an existing interpreter Grace, 
%that enables developers to check 
%that executions of their program are well-typed. % WTF else would you
%need 'em
%
% Grace is designed primarily for education and, consequently,
% the performance profile of its execution is important
% to enable both teachers and students to explore different concepts.
%
% Following from Grace's design goals,
% our focus is to provide flexible checking
% with minimal overhead to execution.
% We achieve flexibility through our shallow-structural design and,
% for our implementation, 
% we achieve minimal overhead by
% taking advantage of common JIT VM techniques 
% that can remove much of the overhead of dynamic type checking;
% allowing programs with explicit dynamic checks 
% to run at roughly the same speed as programs without those checks.
% Overall, adopting common JIT techniques can make these languages
% more effective in practice.
